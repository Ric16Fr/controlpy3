_____________ Original README ---------------

This is researchware code - not ready for production..

There is a lot of "magic-numbers" in the code - will clean this up over time.

Right now its working with Cubase (with the included template)

 - All faderes - (2 way communication) 

 - VU meters (but the data output from Cubase seems useless)

 - PAN (2 way communication, but needs midiloopback)

I use loopMIDI as virtual midi cables (maybe its possible to create this in python)
